The advancement of situational awarenes and military decision-making necessitates the eective utilization of
multimodal defense data, including image and text data generated by numerous air, ground, sea, and space-based
equipments. Military image captioning (MilitIC), as a visual-language learning task, provides innovative solutions for
military image understanding and intelligence generation. However, the scarcity of datasets hinders the advancement
of military image captioning methods, especially those based on deep learning. To overcome this limitation, we
present an open-access benchmark dataset, termed the Military Objects Dataset in Real Combat (MOCO), which
features real combat scenarios and a rich set of captions. Furthermore, we propose a novel encoder-augmentationdecoder
architecture with a Map Augmentation Embedding (MAE) mechanism, MAE-MilitIC, which leverages both
image and text modalities as a guiding prefix for caption generation, and bridge the semantic gap between visual and
textual data. The MAE mechanism maps both image and text embeddings onto a semantic subspace constructed by
relevant military prompts, and augments the military semantics of the image embeddings with attribute-explicit text
embeddings. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that MAE-MilitIC surpasses existing models in
performance on two challenging datasets, providing strong support for military intelligence generation.
